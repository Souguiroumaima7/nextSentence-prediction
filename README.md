# nextSentence-prediction
The project focuses on Next Sentence Prediction using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art model proposed by Google in 2018. Initially developed to improve the understanding of natural language queries for Google Search, BERT has since been fine-tuned for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This project leverages BERT to perform three types of next sentence prediction tasks, including multi-sentence classification, single-sentence classification, and question-answering.

For the Next Sentence Prediction task, BERT is fine-tuned on datasets like MNLI, QQP, QNLI, and SWAG for sentence pairs, and on SST-2 and CoLA for single-sentence classification. Additionally, it is fine-tuned on SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0 for question-answering tasks. The architecture involves tokenizing inputs using the BERT vocabulary and using special tokens like [CLS] for classification and [SEP] for separating different inputs.

# Tech Stack:

1/ Programming Language: Python
2/ Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
3/ Pre-trained Model: BERT
4/ NLP Datasets: MNLI, QQP, QNLI, SWAG, SST-2, CoLA, SQuAD
6/ Libraries and Tools: Transformers (Hugging Face), PyTorch, Scikit-learn

# Conclusion: 

This project showcases the versatility of BERT in handling complex NLP tasks like sentence classification and question-answering. By fine-tuning BERT on different types of datasets, the model is optimized for tasks that involve understanding sentence relationships, semantic equivalence, and syntactic acceptability. This contributes to advancements in NLP models that can better comprehend human language in a variety of contexts.
